Getting Started:

1. On game start, the computer will generate a random 4-color-combination, which is the     
    answer.
2. The player will have 10 tries to guess this 4 color combination.
    2.1 The Player can click on the colored circles on the side to make their color choices.
    2.2 After picking 4 colors, the computer will give feedback on whether the guess is good 
        or not.
    2.3 If the guess is not good, the player can try again, up to a total of 10 times.
    2.4 The computer will display a 'You Win' message if the player guesses correct,    
        otherwise a 'You Lose' message will display after 10 failed guesses, with the option to play again. Each new game will have a different randomly generated answer.
