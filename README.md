PSEUDOCODE:

//'Game rules' and 'high score list' will be a single static page

//When player clicks 'start game' will be taken to the main game.


// game will have the name top center, with the answer hidden behind the name

//still deciding if i should include: 'help' menu will be in the top left with the directions popping up should the player need it.

//score will be in the top right

//timer will start when player makes first pick

//color choices will be on the right side along the border, below which there will be a 'check answer button'

//the player will have 10 chances to guess the code, and there will be 10 lines numbered 10-1 from top to bottom on the left side along the border

//each number will have 4 blank circles to the right of it that will be filled up when the player clicks on a color choice from the color menu.

//the player will have the option to change his choices and so the answer will only be verified when player clicks 'check answer' button

//when player guesses and clicks 'check answer', there will be pegs on the right of his choices that indicate whether he made either a correct color choice (black peg), correct color and placement choice (white peg) or neither(no peg)

//if player guesses the wrong choices, they will get the pegs showing them what they got right, or no pegs if they didnt get anything right

// if player gets the answer right, 'game complete' message will pop up with time taken and points received, and options for a 'new game' or 'back to menu'

//if player gets high score 'new high score' message will pop up
